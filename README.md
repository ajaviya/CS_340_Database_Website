# CS_340_Database_Website
This is the portfolio project for CS 340, which features a database driven website for a fictional movie business which serves as the database for their operations
To use these files, I would reccomend you create the exact same folder and file names in your OSU server space and copy and paste the contents, so that you can connect to your CS_340 database. Don't forget to change my password and acccount info to yours
