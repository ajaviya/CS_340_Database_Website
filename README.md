# CS_340_Database_Website
This is the portfolio project for CS 340, which features a database driven website for a fictional movie business which serves as the database for their operations

# How to use this app
To use these files, I would reccomend you create the exact same folder and file names in your OSU server space and copy and paste the contents of these files to their counterparts on your server folder, so that you can connect to your CS_340 database. Don't forget to change my password and acccount info to yours
